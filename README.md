# JW Streaming Media
A lightweight page for streaming videos.

## Running locally
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and run:

`$ npm install`

`$ npm start`

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Built With
* Node.js
* Vanilla JS
* Less
* Fetch API
* Grunt

## A note on the build process
I prefer running simple node servers with nodemon, a package that watches and restarts the server on changes â€” so building in server functionality for Grunt wasn't necessary. Grunt *does* watch, compile and minify Less to CSS.
